This python library implements a slight variation on the original paper "Bayesian Variable Selection for Nowcasting Economic Time Series" by Steven L. Scott & Hal R. Varian and the corresponding [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/).

You can install `bsts` using

```bash
pip install bsts
```
